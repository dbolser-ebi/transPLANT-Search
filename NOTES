# 0) Find a suitable location



# 1) Download and unpack Solr

### The version of Solr we're currently using!
solr_version=4.4.0

mirror=http://apache.mirrors.timporter.net/lucene/solr

wget $mirror/$solr_version/solr-$solr_version.tgz

tar zxfv solr-$solr_version.tgz 



# 2) Add the transPLANT 'cores' from GIT

## This is bulkier than it needs to be (i.e. we only need a few xml
## files), but it's easier to just cram it all in the repo without
## worrying

cd solr-$solr_version

git clone https://scm.ebi.ac.uk/git/eg-transplant-solr TransPLANT



# 3) Fire up the server on this config...

cd TransPLANT

java -Djetty.port=1234 -jar start.jar



# 4) Later, load data into the index (the transPLANT partner data hasn't
#    been checked into Git)

## After checking that the URL parameter is pointing to the right
## port of the right server...

cd /nfs/production/panda/ensemblgenomes/development/dbolser/TransPLANT

source NOTES.INDEX | tee index.log

## Check the status lines in the index (status should = 0)



# 5) Put this server into production by editing the search config of the
#    transPLANT Drupal site...

## Dan can do this...
